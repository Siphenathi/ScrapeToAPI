Hey bru i hope you doing good, i would advise u not to push packages (node_modules) to github.
its not considered as a good practise, they just consume a space for nothing cause u can go npm install whenever u cloned ur project.
That is y it will take you some time to push you project to github with packages.
=====> Solution <=====
use gitignore it will help prevent packages from being pushed to github.
I'm open to discussions especially the one with code.
If u feel like u have a different opinion u can share it here.
